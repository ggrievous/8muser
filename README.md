# 8muser
A simple python script to download comics from 8muses.

Uses Selenium with chrome driver (http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) to load the pages and BeautifulSoup to scrape the images.

I've also tried to implement threading to improve the overall performance. 

Add the album url i.e the url of the comic issue and then enter the location for the downloads and enjoy :) 

Sample album urls : 

https://www.8muses.com/comics/album/MilfToon-Comics/Milfage/Issue-1

https://www.8muses.com/comics/album/MilfToon-Comics/Lemonade/Lemonade-1
